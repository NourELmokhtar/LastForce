2023-10-08 09:10:52.295 +04:00 [WRN] Server desktop-2rfigff:16476:730f7813 stopped non-gracefully due to DelayedJobScheduler, RecurringJobScheduler. Outstanding work on those dispatchers could be aborted, and there can be delays in background processing. This server instance will be incorrectly shown as active for a while. To avoid non-graceful shutdowns, investigate what prevents from stopping gracefully and add CancellationToken support for those methods.
