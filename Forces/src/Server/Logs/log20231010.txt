2023-10-10 20:01:08.246 +04:00 [WRN] Server desktop-2rfigff:11016:9c400f43 stopped non-gracefully due to Worker. Outstanding work on those dispatchers could be aborted, and there can be delays in background processing. This server instance will be incorrectly shown as active for a while. To avoid non-graceful shutdowns, investigate what prevents from stopping gracefully and add CancellationToken support for those methods.
